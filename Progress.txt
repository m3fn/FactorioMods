
Progress:
   

   ------
   - Rotation
   - Redo strs
   - Copy settings
   - What is on_area_cloned, ctr+c, ctrl+v, ctrl+x
   - Controllinator compatibility
   - Pass any damage to the composite combinator, test biters
   - On died, change component icons - can be checked with .destroy()
   - Check Corpses
   - on_player_*
   - Restrict composite combinator flags (e.g. "building-direction-8-way")
   - Restrict component flags
   - Slots checksum
   - String checksum
   - ChangeLayout does not reset entity
   - Test out Build and remove by hand and with robots
   - Recursive blueprints compatibility
   - Check component's bounds is buggy
   ------
   
   ------
   - Simple memory with shit GUIs an graphics
   - Switch combinator with shit GUIs an graphics
   ------
   
   ------
   - Other unexpected work
   ------
   
   ------
   - overall polish
   - Add errors
   - Unit tests? - check all states of vanilla components
   ------
  
   ------
   - Publish Pre-alpha 0.2 (mod portal) ?
   ------
   
   -------
   - Performance optimizations all around
   -------
   
    -------
    - Find bugs, edge cases
    ------- 
   
   ------
   - Other unexpected work
   - Wait and get feedback from community
   - Index Filter with shit GUIs an graphics
   ------
	



Some time later (IDEAS AND TODO LIST):
- ? Specify component index

- Electricity requirement
- Selection tools and icons graphics
- Draw small leds with components over the combinator
- Working component LEDS
- Working combinator LEDS
- Good graphics
- Complex Distinct combinator GUI
- Add components substrings to substr dict
- Check out unsanctioned components settings change?
- Inteference from other mod, like with script_raised_destroy, script_raised_revive, script_raised_built, on_trigger_created_entity, look for other undesired way of disrupting setup
- Cross-surface configuring, compatibility with any rts-style mods out there (are there any?) -- both at least for distinct constant combinator gui
- Define custom connectors
- Test build performance a bit to know limitations
- Data storage: Combinators with asymmetric collision_box, combinators with collision_box not divisible by data storage collision_box
- Data storage: periemeter only
- Data storage: Bigger sizes data storages

	-- Combinator layout is preserved on blueprinting, here we should gain knowledge about what is current layout
	-- It is much easier to use SaveStateToSlots / RestoreStateInfoFromSlots for this than to lookup current components setup
