   ------

   -------
   - getCompositeCombinatorPrototype
   - getBuildDataSlots
   - remove integer packing from string
   
   - Constant blueprinting, blueprint state return
   - Test out Build and remove by hand and with robots
   - Blueprinting: polish
   
   - Filter combinator with shit GUIs an graphics
   --------
   
   ------
   - Unit tests? - check all states of vanilla components
   - Write mod description (reasonable, for a couple of days, for devs and not)
   - Check component's bounds is buggy
   - Comments for devs

   ------
   - Copy settings
   - What is on_area_cloned, ctr+c, ctrl+v, ctrl+x
   - Controllinator compatibility
   - Pass any damage to the composite combinator, test biters
   - On died, change component icons - can be checked with .destroy()
   - on_player_*
   - Restrict composite combinator flags (e.g. "building-direction-8-way")
   - Restrict component flags
   - Slots checksum
   - String checksum
   - ChangeLayout does not reset entity
   ------

   - Other unexpected work
   - Wait and get feedback from community
   - Index Filter with shit GUIs an graphics
   ------
	



Some time later:
- ? Specify component index

- Selection tools and icons graphics
- Draw small leds with components over the combinator
- Good graphics
- Complex Distinct combinator GUI
- Add components substrings to dict
- Check out unsanctioned components settings change?
- Inteference from other mod, like with script_raised_destroy, script_raised_revive, script_raised_built, on_trigger_created_entity, look for other undesired way of disrupting setup
- Check Corpses
- Cross-surface configuring, compatibility with any rts-style mods out there (are there any?) -- both at least for distinct constant combinator gui
- Define custom connectors
- Cleanup
- Polish eveything with grumpy look
- Test build performance a bit to know limitations
