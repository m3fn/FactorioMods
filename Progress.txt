Some time later:
- ? Specify component index

- Selection tools and icons graphics
- Do not store spawned entities in dict, on blueprinting get all position info from entities themselves
- Draw small leds on components
- Good graphics
- Complex Distinct combinator GUI
- Add components substrings to dict
- Check out unsanctioned components settings change?
- Inteference from other mod, like with script_raised_destroy, script_raised_revive, script_raised_built, on_trigger_created_entity, look for other undesired way of disrupting setup
- Check Corpses
- Cross-surface configuring, compatibility with any rts-style mods out there (are there?) -- both at least for distinct constant combinator gui
