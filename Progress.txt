Some time later:
- ? Specify component index

- Selection tools and icons graphics
- Draw small leds with components over the combinator
- Good graphics
- Complex Distinct combinator GUI
- Add components substrings to dict
- Check out unsanctioned components settings change?
- Inteference from other mod, like with script_raised_destroy, script_raised_revive, script_raised_built, on_trigger_created_entity, look for other undesired way of disrupting setup
- Check Corpses
- Cross-surface configuring, compatibility with any rts-style mods out there (are there any?) -- both at least for distinct constant combinator gui
- Define custom connectors
- Cleanup
- Polish eveything with grumpy look
- Test build performance a bit to know limitations
