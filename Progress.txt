   ------
   - overall polish

   - on_player_*
   - Restrict composite combinator flags (e.g. "building-direction-8-way")
   - Restrict component flags
   - Slots checksum
   - String checksum
   - ChangeLayout does not reset entity
   - Remove index assignments

Some time later (TODO LIST):
- ? Specify component index

- Electricity requirement
- Selection tools and icons graphics
- Draw small leds with components over the combinator
- Good graphics
- Complex Distinct combinator GUI
- Add components substrings to dict
- Check out unsanctioned components settings change?
- Inteference from other mod, like with script_raised_destroy, script_raised_revive, script_raised_built, on_trigger_created_entity, look for other undesired way of disrupting setup
- Check Corpses
- Cross-surface configuring, compatibility with any rts-style mods out there (are there any?) -- both at least for distinct constant combinator gui
- Define custom connectors
- Polish eveything with grumpy look
- Test build performance a bit to know limitations
- Check component's bounds is buggy
