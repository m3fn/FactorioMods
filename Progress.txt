
Progress:

   ------
   - Attach info to blueprints, spawn from str
   - Remove dataslots
   - Test out Build and remove by hand and with robots
   
   - Slots checksum
   - String checksum
   - Add components substrings to substr dict
   
   - Check component's bounds is buggy
   - Redo strs
   ------
   
   ------
   - Copy settings
   - What is on_area_cloned, ctr+c, ctrl+v, ctrl+x
   - Restrict composite combinator flags (e.g. "building-direction-8-way")
   - Restrict component flags
   - Rotation
   - Controllinator compatibility
   - Pass any damage to the composite combinator, test biters
   - On died, change component icons - can be checked with .destroy()
   - Check Corpses
   - on_player_*
   - Draw small leds with components over the combinator
   - Working component LEDS
   - Working combinator LEDS
   ------
   
   ------
   - 0.2.0
   - Publish on mod portal
   ------
   
   ------
   - Recursive blueprints compatibility
   - ChangeLayout does not reset entity
   - Define custom connectors
   ------
   
   ------
   - Exclusive filter combinator with shit GUIs an graphics
   - Advanced filter combinator with shit GUIs an graphics
   - Simple memory with shit GUIs an graphics
   - Switch combinator with shit GUIs an graphics
   - Index Filter with shit GUIs an graphics
   ------


Some time later (IDEAS AND TODO LIST):
- ? Specify component index

- Electricity requirement
- Selection tools and icons graphics
- Good graphics
- Check out unsanctioned components settings change?
- Inteference from other mod, like with script_raised_destroy, script_raised_revive, script_raised_built, on_trigger_created_entity, look for other undesired way of disrupting setup
- Cross-surface configuring, compatibility with any rts-style mods out there (are there any?) -- both at least for distinct constant combinator gui
- Test build performance a bit to know limitations
- Data storage: Combinators with asymmetric collision_box, combinators with collision_box not divisible by data storage collision_box
- Data storage: periemeter only
- Data storage: Bigger sizes data storages
- Add errors
- Unit tests? - check all states of vanilla components
- Performance optimizations all around
- Find bugs, edge cases


	-- Combinator layout is preserved on blueprinting, here we should gain knowledge about what is current layout
	-- It is much easier to use SaveStateToSlots / RestoreStateInfoFromSlots for this than to lookup current components setup
